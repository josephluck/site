# 2020 in review

As software engineers, we're used to the process of retrospection at the end of a sprint of work, it helps keep ourselves honest with how we're performing as team and it acts as an opportunity to look back on what we're proud of achieving.

2020 has now drawn to a close, and here's a retrospective and roundup on the things I'm most proud of:

---

## I went fully remote

Like many in 2020, the COVID pandemic meant that I had to quickly adjust to working remotely. Fortunately, being a software engineer, most of my communcation was already asynchronous and it was relatively effortless transitioning to working remotely, particularly as I had worked stints remotely in the past before.

---

## I joined a major retail bank

It's ironic. When I was young, I was convinced I would never work a standard 9-to-5, let alone at a "stuffy" bank. I could not be more wrong. I joined NatWest as a senior mobile engineer building React Native applications in a cross-functional product team üòé

---

## I helped shut down a venture bank

Volatility in start ups is a certainly a thing that you often hear about, even if said start up is inside one of the largest retail banks. 5 months in to my stint at Bo, the difficult decision was made to shut it down. I was involved in the process of updating the website to notify our customers of the news (something that I had to do just hours after the news was announced to internal staff).

---

## I joined another venture bank

After Bo, I joined [Mettle](https://www.mettle.co.uk/) as a senior mobile engineer. Although Mettle was another venture bank within NatWest, the culture, tech stack and ways of working were very different! I joined a cross-functional product team improving the Onboarding experience for Mettle's mobile application.

---

## I learnt GraphQL

I quickly learned GraphQL (both server and client) including code generation, schemas, dealing with breaking changes and the ins-and-outs of contract testing using PACT.

---

## I built a state machine library

Mettle's onboarding journey is _super_ complex, and it had a proprietary state machine implementation powering it. This state machine operated on a blob of JSON data to determine which screen to show the customer based on the information they have entered, and supported rehydration. Very cool! I became obsessed with how to implement such a state machine (particularly because the implementation at Mettle was overly complex) and as a result, I built [Machi](https://github.com/josephluck/machi).

---

## I led a major codebase language migration

Mettle's mobile application was written in FlowType. Most engineers there didn't like it, and would have preferred to use TypeScript instead. I took the lead on planning and executing a codebase-wide migration from FlowType to TypeScript at the end of the year.

Here's to 2021 üçª
