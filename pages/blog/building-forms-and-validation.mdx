# Building forms and validation

In this post I'll be detailing how I approached form state management and validation for a side-project of mine, [Urban Jungle](https://github.com/josephluck/urban-jungle).

Typically in side projects, I like identify problems and solve them in novel ways, ways that I would not usually have the fortune to explore in my professional day job as a software engineer. Often by exploring new solutions, I further my understanding of the problem in a way that generalises to solutions I _do_ need to explore in my day to day.

## What's the problem we're solving?

Urban Jungle doesn't have _that many_ forms, however I wanted to build an abstraction in React that would allow me to define a data schema in TypeScript and to be able to build state management and validation on top of that well-defined schema in a way that afforded great editor auto completion and full type safety.

I also wanted a clear separation of concerns, i.e. I didn't want to litter my business logic with form state management too much (though the abstraction should allow the consumer to manually change values and internal state where required) - for that reason I wanted a separate library to deal with form state management that I could use independently from the rest of the logic of the feature.

I also explored a purely functional and strongly typed approach with Urban Jungle and leveraged the amazing [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library to do so. For this reason, I'm using fp-ts inside the implementation of the form library. Apologies if you're not massively familiar with fp-ts or functional programming in general, I hope that the ideas I'm showing here will have merit despite the implementation details of the actual code demonstrated.

## What does it look like?

Whenever I build an abstraction like this, I always try to start with what the requirements are (see above) and then what the external API will look like. Usually I'll go through a few different ideas before I settle on one, but I usually put code to editor to "prototype" the external API before I implement the internals.

Enough talk though, here's a quick snapshot of what I imagined the use of the library to be like (I've cheated here and actually recorded myself building a new form using the library post-facto!):

<Video src="/static/use-form/use-form.mp4" />

And here's the code:

```typescript
type Fields = {
  name: string;
  nickname: string;
  location: string;
  avatar: ImageModel;
};

type ImageModel = {
  uri: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
};

const {
  submit,
  registerTextInput,
  registerSinglePickerInput,
  registerCameraField,
} = useForm<Fields>(
  {
    name: "",
    nickname: "",
    location: "",
    avatar: {
      uri: "",
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
    },
  },
  {
    name: [constraints.isRequired, constraints.alphaNumeric],
    nickname: [constraints.atLeastLength(5)],
    location: [],
    avatar: [constraints.isValidImageModel],
  }
);

const onSubmit = () => {
  pipe(
    TE.fromEither(submit()),
    TE.chain((values) => save(values))
  );
};

return (
  <FormContainer onSubmit={onSubmit}>
    <TextField label="Name" {...registerTextInput("name")} />
    <TextField label="Nickname" {...registerTextInput("nickname")} />
    <PickerField
      label="Location"
      multiValue={false}
      options={locations.map((value) => ({
        value,
        label: location,
      }))}
      {...registerSinglePickerInput("location")}
    />
    <CameraField
      label="Picture"
      type="plant"
      {...registerCameraField("avatar")}
    />
  </FormContainer>
);
```

And here's the same code with comments explaining a few bits and pieces:

```typescript
// we'll define a schema of our form fields as a simple object type
type Fields = {
  name: string; // a simple scalar value
  nickname: string;
  location: string;
  avatar: ImageModel; // application-specific data types should be supported too, i.e. we'll have a CameraField component that produces an `ImageModel`.
};

type ImageModel = {
  uri: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
};

const {
  submit, // submit should run the validation and let the caller know whether everything's valid or not
  registerTextInput, // a function that binds a text field to the form. Provides state management for the field as well as error, touched state and any other information the field needs. MUST be strongly typed to the schema i.e. registerTextInput('name') works, but 'nameee' and 'avatar' throw compile time errors.
  registerSinglePickerInput,
  registerCameraField, // only keys in the schema that match the camera field's value requirements can be registered, i.e. registerCameraField('avatar') will work, whereas 'location' will not.
} = useForm<Fields>(
  // the first argument will be the default values for the form
  {
    name: "",
    nickname: "",
    location: "",
    avatar: {
      uri: "",
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
    },
  },
  // the second argument will be our validation constraints for each field. We'll use Valley to actually implement validation: https://github.com/josephluck/valley
  {
    name: [constraints.isRequired, constraints.alphaNumeric], // multiple constraints are supported
    nickname: [constraints.atLeastLength(5)],
    location: [], // optional fields are supported
    avatar: [constraints.isValidImageModel],
  }
);

const onSubmit = () => {
  // validation uses fp-ts
  pipe(
    TE.fromEither(submit()),
    TE.chain((values) => save(values)) // submit returns the values of the form for ergonomics
  );
};

return (
  <FormContainer onSubmit={onSubmit}>
    <TextField label="Name" {...registerTextInput("name")} />
    <TextField label="Nickname" {...registerTextInput("nickname")} />
    <PickerField
      label="Location"
      multiValue={false}
      options={locations.map((value) => ({
        value,
        label: location,
      }))}
      {...registerSinglePickerInput("location")}
    />
    <CameraField
      label="Picture"
      type="plant"
      {...registerCameraField("avatar")}
    />
  </FormContainer>
);
```

There are a few key things I would like to point out about this implementation:

**Type safety**

I focused on ensuring that the usage of the `useForm` hook is _fully_ type safe. And I don't mean simply that `useForm` returns type safe functions and values (i.e. `type RegisterTextInput = (key: string) => TextFieldProps`), but rather the type safety _knows about the schema_ (i.e. `type RegisterTextInput = (key: StringKeys<Fields>) => TextFieldProps`) - no compromises!.

I'm a strong believer that leveraging the type system to this extent greatly reduces the number of bugs and inconsistencies that develop in a code base, allows for much easier and safer refactoring, as well as serving as a form of documentation for developers - not to mention the editor autocompletion which we'll get to later on.

Here's an example of a type error when using an incompatible key when registering a field:

<Image src="/static/use-form/invalid-registration.png" />

> `registerCameraField` knows the keys in the schema that are of the type that `<CameraField />` accepts.

**Developer experience**

With everything I build, I strive to deliver the best developer experience. There are many principles that I value when it comes to this, however one that I find incredibly valuable is leveraging TypeScript's ability to provide editor auto completion. As shown in the video above, users of this library are able to leverage very good editor auto completion driven by the schema when registering inputs and using return values of the library.

Here's a couple of examples of editor autocompletion when registering a image fields:

<Image src="/static/use-form/editor-autocompletion.png" />

> Because we're so strongly typed, vscode gives us a choice of keys that are compatible for registration with the `<CameraField />`

And another example for string fields:

<Image src="/static/use-form/editor-autocompletion-string.png" />

> Similarly, vscode gives us a choice of keys that are compatible for registration with the `<TextField />`

**Separation of concerns**

The form state management as well as validation are grouped together in a single concern (and a simple place) allowing the state and validation to be managed independently from the UI components. For example, the `<TextField />` has no knowledge of the internal workings of the form state management or validation, all it cares about is receiving a string value, updating the parent component when a change in the value happens and receiving an error string when an error should be displayed. This separation of concerns means that the form state management and the `<TextField />` component can change independently, as they have no direct dependency on one another (other than the facility to spread props over to "register" a component, but this is done through the type system rather than being a tight runtime coupling of the two).

In addition, the form state management and validation are completely separate to the business logic of what happens when the data is actually used (aka the form is submitted). The library provides a `submit` function that simply runs validation and provides the current values of the form fields, but it does not manage actually doing anything with the data, loading states or anything else. It's carefully and intentionally scoped in it's responsibility to simply manage form state and validation really well, and nothing more.

**Constraints**

The final thing I would like to point out is that not only are the fields themselves fully type safe to the schema, but the constraints are too.

This library uses Valley (a validation library I wrote) for it's validation, which expects strongly-typed constraint functions. These strong types are fed through from the schema such that it's only permitted by the compiler to provide a string constraint to a constraint configuration for a schema key that is a string for example.

Again, I find this to be a really important feature, as it allows the user to be confident that they are configuring their form correctly by ensuring that only compatible constraints are permitted be used against the schema.

Here's an example of the type error when using an incompatible number constraint against a string field:

<Image src="/static/use-form/invalid-constraint.png" />

> The library enforces the constraints for the schema to be compatible with the value types. Here it's complaining because we've attempted to use a constraint that operates on numbers against the `name` key in the schema, which is a string.

```

### How the types work

The first thing I'd like to pull out is how the type safety works from the schema. You'll notice that there's a generic type argument to `useForm` which extends a `Record<string, any>` type. This type constraint means that the form hook only manages objects.

From the generic type, additional types are created such as `type StringKeys`, `type NumberKeys`, `type MultiPickerKeys` and `type CameraKeys`. These additional types are used in the registration functions to strongly type the name of the field that should be registered.

## Registration functions

One thing I quite like about this library is the ease in which you can bind values, callbacks, error states etc to a field. For example, `<TextField {...registerTextInput('name')} />` is all you need.

The registration functions are typed to take a string key which is one of the strongly-typed keys from the schema that match the type of input, aka, `string` for `<TextField />` components, `number` for `<NumberField />` components, etc, and are expected to return an object of props that the respective component expects. You'll see the prop types imported at the top of the library.

Unfortunately, it's for this very reason that this library cannot effectively be open-sourced, as the requirements for these registration functions are heavily dependent on the specifics of the internals of the components that use these registration functions.

One of the great aspects of the registration functions is that if the requirements of the field component change, the compiler will let us know and we can ensure that the form state management conforms to what the components are expecting.

## Validation

You'll notice a `doValidate` function that uses Valley's `makeValidator` factory function. Valley is a validation library I made, and I wanted to use it for Urban Jungle, however it would be trivial to swap out Valley for another validation library for example, `yup` would make a good choice.

I chose to use Valley as it implements `fp-ts` compatible validation using `Either` and `TaskEither` which Urban Jungle uses heavily for controlling business logic.

The bulk of the validation logic resides in the `validate` function which simply calls `doValidate` and sets errors in the state (if there are any).

# Wrapping up

I hope this article has shown you the way I think about abstracting things away by prioritising developer experience, type safety and maintainability of the outside use.
