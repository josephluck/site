## Open Source

I'm a keen contributor to open-source and often publish my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/josephluck) and [Npm](https://npmjs.com/~josephluck). I'm particularly proud of [Stately](https://github.com/josephluck/stately), a simple functional state management library and [Helix](https://github.com/josephluck/helix), a batteries included functional front-end framework providing state-management, routing and rendering with React.

## Personal Projects

During my free time, I like to experiment with new technologies and improve my design and user experience skills. To this end, I enjoy building my own tools and products:

[Stately](https://github.com/josephluck/stately) is a simple, functional and immutable state management library for TypeScript complete with bindings for React Hooks and Next.js.

[Internote](https://internote.app/) is a distraction-free note editor built on top of a modern "serverless" stack consisting of TypeScript, React, Next, Styled Components and Twine on the front-end and TypeScript with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and a slew of other AWS services on the back-end.

[Keepies](https://github.com/josephluck/keepies) is a chrome extension that automatically takes screenshots of web apps at set intervals to aid front-end developers and designers curate their portfolio. Keepies is open-source and is written in TypeScript with React.

[Wtf.js](https://github.com/josephluck/wtf) (What The Forecast?!) is a terminal weather app written in TypeScript. It was written on a particularly cold winters weekend.
